# UI for Pods

This is a work in progress to improve [Pods](http://pods.io/) user interface through additional CSS classes.

The goal is to add custom titles, placeholders, show/hide fields with selects, etc.

### First Stage
- [x] Inline Title
- [x] Custom Title
- [x] Placeholder
- [x] Hidden Label
- [ ] Horizontal Rule
- [ ] Show/Hide Selects

### Second Stage
- [ ] Tabs
- [ ] Custom user style

---

## How does it work?
*Use the following text structures by inserting them in the Additional CSS classes field.*

### Inline Title
`pods_inline_title`


### Custom Title

#### Placeholder

#### Hidden label
